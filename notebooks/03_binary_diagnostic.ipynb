    "### --- Day 3: Binary Diagnostic ---\n",
    "\n",
    "The submarine has been making some odd creaking noises, so you ask it to produce a diagnostic report just in case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagnostic report (your puzzle input) consists of a list of binary numbers which, when decoded properly, can tell you many useful things about the conditions of the submarine. The first parameter to check is the **power consumption**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to use the binary numbers in the diagnostic report to generate two new binary numbers (called the **gamma rate** and the **epsilon rate**). The power consumption can then be found by multiplying the gamma rate by the epsilon rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each bit in the gamma rate can be determined by finding the **most common bit in the corresponding position** of all numbers in the diagnostic report. For example, given the following diagnostic report:\n",
    "```\n",
    "00100\n",
    "11110\n",
    "10110\n",
    "10111\n",
    "10101\n",
    "01111\n",
    "00111\n",
    "11100\n",
    "10000\n",
    "11001\n",
    "00010\n",
    "01010\n",
    "```\n",
    "Considering only the first bit of each number, there are five `0` bits and seven `1` bits. Since the most common bit is `1`, the first bit of the gamma rate is `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common second bit of the numbers in the diagnostic report is `0`, so the second bit of the gamma rate is `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common value of the third, fourth, and fifth bits are `1`, `1`, and `0`, respectively, and so the final three bits of the gamma rate are `110`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the gamma rate is the binary number `10110`, or `22` in decimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The epsilon rate is calculated in a similar way; rather than use the most common bit, the least common bit from each position is used. So, the epsilon rate is `01001`, or `9` in decimal. Multiplying the gamma rate (`22`) by the epsilon rate (`9`) produces the power consumption, `198`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the binary numbers in your diagnostic report to calculate the gamma rate and epsilon rate, then multiply them together. **What is the power consumption of the submarine?** (Be sure to represent your answer in decimal, not binary.)\n"

    "\n",
    "Both the oxygen generator rating and the CO2 scrubber rating are values that can be found in your diagnostic report - finding them is the tricky part. Both values are located using a similar process that involves filtering out values until only one remains. Before searching for either rating value, start with the full list of binary numbers from your diagnostic report and **consider just the first bit** of those numbers. Then:\n",

    "\n",
    "- To find **oxygen generator rating**, determine the **most common** value (`0` or `1`) in the current bit position, and keep only numbers with that bit in that position. If `0` and `1` are equally common, keep values with a `1` in the position being considered.\n",
    "- To find **CO2 scrubber rating**, determine the **least common** value (`0` or `1`) in the current bit position, and keep only numbers with that bit in that position. If `0` and `1` are equally common, keep values with a `0` in the position being considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to determine the **oxygen generator rating** value using the same example diagnostic report from above:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start with all 12 numbers and consider only the first bit of each number. There are more `1` bits (7) than `0` bits (5), so keep only the 7 numbers with a `1` in the first position: `11110`, `10110`, `10111`, `10101`, `11100`, `10000`, and `11001`.\n",
    "- Then, consider the second bit of the 7 remaining numbers: there are more `0` bits (4) than `1` bits (3), so keep only the 4 numbers with a `0` in the second position: `10110`, `10111`, `10101`, and `10000`.\n",
    "- In the third position, three of the four numbers have a `1`, so keep those three: `10110`, `10111`, and `10101`.\n",
    "- In the fourth position, two of the three numbers have a `1`, so keep those two: `10110` and `10111`.\n",
    "- In the fifth position, there are an equal number of `0` bits and `1` bits (one each). So, to find the **oxygen generator rating**, keep the number with a `1` in that position: `10111`.\n",
    "- As there is only one number left, stop; the **oxygen generator rating** is `10111`, or `23` in decimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, to determine the **CO2 scrubber rating** value from the same example above:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start again with all 12 numbers and consider only the first bit of each number. There are fewer `0` bits (5) than `1` bits (7), so keep only the 5 numbers with a `0` in the first position: `00100`, `01111`, `00111`, `00010`, and `01010`.\n",
    "- Then, consider the second bit of the 5 remaining numbers: there are fewer `1` bits (2) than `0` bits (3), so keep only the 2 numbers with a `1` in the second position: `01111` and `01010`.\n",
    "- In the third position, there are an equal number of `0` bits and `1` bits (one each). So, to find the **CO2 scrubber rating**, keep the number with a `0` in that position: `01010`.\n",
    "- As there is only one number left, stop; the **CO2 scrubber rating** is `01010`, or `10` in decimal.\n",
