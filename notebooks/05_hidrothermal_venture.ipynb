    "You come across a field of [hydrothermal vents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_vent) on the ocean floor! These vents constantly produce large, opaque clouds, so it would be best to avoid them if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "They tend to form in **lines**; the submarine helpfully produces a list of nearby lines of vents (your puzzle input) for you to review. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "0,9 -> 5,9\n",
    "8,0 -> 0,8\n",
    "9,4 -> 3,4\n",
    "2,2 -> 2,1\n",
    "7,0 -> 7,4\n",
    "6,4 -> 2,0\n",
    "0,9 -> 2,9\n",
    "3,4 -> 1,4\n",
    "0,0 -> 8,8\n",
    "5,5 -> 8,2\n",
    "```\n",
    "Each line of vents is given as a line segment in the format `x1,y1 -> x2,y2` where `x1`,`y1` are the coordinates of one end the line segment and `x2`,`y2` are the coordinates of the other end. These line segments include the points at both ends. In other words:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An entry like `1,1 -> 1,3` covers points `1,1`, `1,2`, and `1,3`.\n",
    "- An entry like `9,7 -> 7,7` covers points `9,7`, `8,7`, and `7,7`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, **only consider horizontal and vertical lines**: lines where either `x1 = x2` or `y1 = y2`.\n",
    "\n",

    "222111....\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this diagram, the top left corner is `0,0` and the bottom right corner is `9,9`. Each position is shown as **the number of lines which cover that point** or `.` if no line covers that point. The top-left pair of `1`s, for example, comes from `2,2 -> 2,1`; the very bottom row is formed by the overlapping lines `0,9 -> 5,9` and `0,9 -> 2,9`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid the most dangerous areas, you need to determine **the number of points where at least two lines overlap**. In the above example, this is anywhere in the diagram with a `2` or larger - a total of **`5`** points.\n",
